# Car-price-prediction

Here, we get data filled with information on a wide variety of cars, including their selling price and present price. We realize that we can use this data to make sure we get a good deal on a new car. In particular, we can figure out exactly how much one should pay for a specific type of car.
Deciding whether a used car is worth the posted price when you see listings online can be difficult. Several factors, including mileage, make, model, year, etc. can influence the actual worth of a car. From the perspective of a seller, it is also a dilemma to price a used car appropriately. Based on existing data, the aim is to use machine learning algorithms to develop models for predicting used car prices.
This research aims to develop a good regression model to offer accurate prediction of car price. In order to do this, we need some previous data of used cars for which we use price and some other standard attributes. Car price is considered as the dependent variable while other attributes as the independent variables.
Random Forest is an ensemble learning based regression model. It uses a model called decision tree, specifically as the name suggests, multiple decision trees to generate the ensemble model which collectively produces a prediction.
